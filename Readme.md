# Sanias Art Gallery
This project was created for my partner as part of her university degree. She needed a website to showcase her work as an artist, and to allow people to view, comment and purchase pieces. This website has been further developed from ‘My First Milestone Project’.

The client specified the need for a responsive website that is clear, simple and easy to use, while reflecting her style as an artist. I had a look at her work and found that she works with clean lines, keeping her colour palette simple to just black and white. I have reflected this through the design of my website by keeping to a monochromatic colour scheme with simple features.


# UX
This website has quite a specific target audience. The target audience of this website are people who are interested in finding out more about Sania Nadeem as an artist, viewing her artworks and purchasing them.
This project helps to bring these things to the target audience by presenting the artist’s work through a simple and easy to use website that is responsive on different devices. The website is easy to navigate as well as looking aesthetic in line with the artist's theme. The website also showcases the artist’s work through a clear grid format on the ‘works’ page.

# Deployment
This project is hosted on Heruko on https://freds-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/

### Local deployment:

1.) I created an env.py file in the my root directory and added all the following information on it:

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY",'Key details')

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL",'Key details')

os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE",'Key details')

os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET",'Key details')

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",'Key details')

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",'Key details')

2.) I then added the following code to my settings file:

import dj_database_url
from os import path

if path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}

3.) After I had finished adding the code above, I typed in the following:

python3 manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

### Heruko deployment:

1.) I created a requirements.txt and Procfile through the following code :

- pip freeze > requirements.txt
- echo web: python3 app.py > Procfile

2.) I then commited all my files on to Github through the following code:

- git add
- git commit -m "(description)"
- git push origin master

3.) I created a new app on the Heruko page and then clicked on "Deploy". This lead me to a page where I 
could click on "Deployment method" to select Github. This would link the Heruko app to the Github page.

4.) Once my app was linked with Github, I added all of my config vars.

5.) After all the steps above had been completed, I clicked on the "Deploy Branch" button in the "Deploy" page.
